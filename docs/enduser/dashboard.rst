The dashboard is the common web user interface for OpenStack. It is a
simple web GUI where you can perform regular tasks, including
provision instances, set up access control, provision volumes etc.


Project tab
-----------

Projects are organizational units in the cloud, and are also known as
tenants or accounts. Each user is a member of one or more
projects. Within a project, a user creates and manages instances.

From the Project tab, you can view and manage the resources in a
selected project, including instances and images. You can select the
project from the drop down menu at the top left.
