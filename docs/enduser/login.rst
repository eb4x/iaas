Which dashboard?
----------------

Currently the UH-IaaS is deployed in two locations, UiB and UiO. To
log in to the UiB dashboard, point your browser to:

  https://dashboard.iaas.uib.no/

If you want to use the UiO dashboard, point your browser to:

  https://dashboard.iaas.uio.no/

Which one is right for you? It depends on which cloud deployment you
wish to use. If you're a UiO user, you may want to use the
infrastructure at UiO. Similarly, as a UiB user, you'll probably want
to use the UiB version. Currently, the two implementations are
identical.


The login screen
----------------

Regardless of which of the locations' dashboard you connect to, you'll
be presented with the following:
