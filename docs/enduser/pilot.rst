.. WARNING::
   This document is under construction.


Who can use this service
------------------------

The UH-IaaS service will, in its pilot phase be available to all users
at UiB and UiO. The compute and storage resources, as well as IP
address pool available are limited, however. For this reason, we ask
that testers exercise restraint, and terminate instances that are no
longer needed.


Purpose of the pilot
--------------------

The main purpose of the pilot is to allow interrested users to
acclimate to this type of service. It also allows the administrators
and implementers to test the service using real customers. It is
important that testers report bugs, missing documentation etc.


Which data can you put here
---------------------------

Only insensitive data can be stored in the UH-IaaS cloud during its
pilot phase.


Uptime and SLAs
---------------

We do not guarantee anything during the pilot phase. We will try to
keep things up and running, but this is done on a best effort basis.

Every three weeks, we will schedule a downtime window where all
services in the cloud will be reinstalled. When this happens, all
instances will be terminated.


Contact
-------

The administrators from UiB and UiO can be reached

* By IRC at #uh-sky at freenode.net
