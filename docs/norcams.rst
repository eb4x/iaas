========================
What is NorCAMS anyways?
========================

It is nothing more than a name label, really. Or a lot more, if you choose for
it to be. Pretty confusing, right?

To provide some background on it, when starting to collaborate between
the universities it became apparent that we needed a name of some sort to
identify us and what we were trying to do. Key words where technology,
collabration and learning to continuosly improve.

In order to have *something* the NorCAMS name was invented and presented at a
meetup in Troms√∏ early 2014. It is a play on words created from the words
*Norwegian* (or it could be *Nordic*?) and CAMS. CAMS is an acronym (we all
love them, right?) coined in 2010 by Damon Edwards and John Willis at the first
US based Devopsdays. It stands for Culture, Automation, Measurement and Sharing
and has become a mantra for the devops community and concept.

NorCAMS is used as an identifier of the open source and collabration aspect of
the formal UH-sky IaaS project. It is useful in several ways, possibly mostly
as a marker to show our ambition to be truly open. By not using a more offical
name we hope to not scare off anyone, thus maybe attracting contributors?
