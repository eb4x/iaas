Introduction
============

.. _OpenStack Security Guide: http://docs.openstack.org/security-guide/

This document is an attempt to write up all the security measures that
can, will or should be implemented. The basis is the `OpenStack
Security Guide`_ on openstack.org. We use the sections in the security
guide, and try to answer the following questions:

#. Is this security measure implemented? and if not:
#. What are the potential security impact?
#. Other concerns?
#. Should this be implemented?


System documentation
====================

+-------------------------+---------------------+
| **Impact**              | Low                 |
+-------------------------+---------------------+
| **Implemented percent** | **0%** (0/4)        |
+-------------------------+---------------------+

System Inventory
----------------

From `OpenStack Security Guide`_:

  Documentation should provide a general description of the OpenStack
  environment and cover all systems used (production, development,
  test, etc.). Documenting system components, networks, services, and
  software often provides the birdâ€™s-eye view needed to thoroughly
  cover and consider security concerns, attack vectors and possible
  security domain bridging points. A system inventory may need to
  capture ephemeral resources such as virtual machines or virtual disk
  volumes that would otherwise be persistent resources in a
  traditional IT system.

The UH-IaaS infrastructure is, from hardware and up, managed
completely by the UH-IaaS group, and therefore independent of each
institution. Links to infrastructure documentation:

Management
==========

+-------------------------+---------------------+
| **Impact**              | Medium              |
+-------------------------+---------------------+
| **Implemented percent** | **0%** (0/4)        |
+-------------------------+---------------------+

Continuous systems management
-----------------------------

From `OpenStack Security Guide`_:

  A cloud will always have bugs. Some of these will be security
  problems. For this reason, it is critically important to be prepared
  to apply security updates and general software updates. This
  involves smart use of configuration management tools, which are
  discussed below. This also involves knowing when an upgrade is
  necessary.
