From `OpenStack Security Guide\: Shared File Systems`_:

  *The Shared File Systems service (manila) provides a set of services
  for management of shared file systems in a multi-tenant cloud
  environment, similar to how OpenStack provides for block-based
  storage management through the OpenStack Block Storage service
  project. With the Shared File Systems service, you can create a
  remote file system, mount the file system on your instances, and
  then read and write data from your instances to and from your file
  system.*

.. NOTE::
   Does not apply. We are not using Manila.
