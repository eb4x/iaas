.. _OpenStack Security Guide: http://docs.openstack.org/security-guide/

This document is an attempt to write up all the security measures that
can, will or should be implemented. The basis is the `OpenStack
Security Guide`_ on openstack.org. We use the sections in the security
guide, and try to answer the following questions:

#. Is this security measure implemented? and if not:
#. What are the potential security impact?
#. Other concerns?
#. Should this be implemented?

For each recommendation, there is at least one check that can have one
of four different values:

* ``[PASS]`` This check has been passed
* ``[FAIL]`` This check is failed
* ``[----]`` This check has not been considered yet
* ``[DEFERRED]`` This check has been postponed or does not apply
