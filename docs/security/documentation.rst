From `OpenStack Security Guide\: System documentation`_:

  *Documentation should provide a general description of the OpenStack
  environment and cover all systems used (production, development,
  test, etc.). Documenting system components, networks, services, and
  software often provides the birdâ€™s-eye view needed to thoroughly
  cover and consider security concerns, attack vectors and possible
  security domain bridging points. A system inventory may need to
  capture ephemeral resources such as virtual machines or virtual disk
  volumes that would otherwise be persistent resources in a
  traditional IT system.*

The UH-IaaS infrastructure is, from hardware and up, managed
completely by the UH-IaaS group, and therefore independent of each
institution. Except for networking interface and physical hardware
management, there are no dependencies on the institutions. Links to
infrastructure documentation:

  A high-level view of the hardware inventory is documented in the
  document `Physical hardware`_.
