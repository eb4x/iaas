=======
Ansible
=======

The ansible playbooks we use are found on github at
https://github.com/norcams/ansible

In the documentation :file:`$ANSIBLE` will be refered to as the directory
where you have cloned the ansible repo. This will by default be
:file:`$HOME/ansible`.

You should clone this repo to your home catalog on each login node::

  git clone git@github.com:norcams/ansible

You will need access to your SSH-key (tip: use ssh -A <login>)

Setup
=====

Please refer to :file:`README.md`
