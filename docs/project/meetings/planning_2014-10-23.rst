Outcome
-------

- Jump hosts ideally need to provide redundancy for access across locations.

- Ideally we'd want access across the infrastructure for both in- and
  out-of-band managmenet (switches and servers).

- It was (again) suggested that we use private IP addressing for at least the
  out-of-band management, maybe also the in-band management.

- Discussion is not finalized

Actions
-------

- Identify IP segments (/24 with possibility for /23)

- Write a spec of how we want the public (service) IP segment routed across two
  fibers (static routes, how does redundancy/failover work with this?)


2. Illustrate and document cabling of the equipment
===================================================

We need to make a cabling illustration to show our current plan for
connectivity.

Actions
-------

- Jan Ivar, Tor and Raymond will make a draft next week. Hege will need to
  verify and ask questions :-)

3. Keeping people busy the next weeks
=====================================

Jan Ivar and Tor are at Devopsdays Ghent next week, and a lot of people in and
around the project will go to Paris for Openstack Summit the week after.

We should write up some tasks and TODOs for winch to keep people busy when they
feel ready to move on with PUppet.

Actions
-------

- Jan Ivar adds more open cards to Planned in Trello, focusing on winch and
  Puppet

4. Better ability to draw sketches during a meeting
===================================================

When discussing we need a better ability to draw and sketch stuff during
meetings.

Actions
-------

- We tested a few solutions and https://awwapp.com seems like it might fit our
  needs. We'll try using it over the next few meetings.
