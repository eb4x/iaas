Tracking the project
====================

Chat room
---------

All members of the project are expected to join and follow our chat room while
working. The chat room is used for socializing, status updates, informal quick
questions and coordinating various group efforts.

Commit messages from the most important git repositories we use are announced
in the chat room automatically.

To start using the chat room connect to a IRC server on the Freenode network
and join the #uh-sky room. Remember, everything in the room is logged on the
public internet at https://botbot.me/freenode/uh-sky/

Tasks and progress reporting
----------------------------

The project uses a Trello board for tasks and project planning. Core members
are expected to add and manage cards directly on the board. Tasks described on
the cards should not be too complicated to solve, ideally we want cards to flow
through the board each day. If we do this correctly we get a low-cost,
low-friction way of reporting progress and status.

*Divide and conquer* seems like a good idea to try for this. If a card stays in
the same column for a day, divide it and try to get smaller parts of it to Done!

The Goals column is a bit special. This is where we put larger goals and
milestones broken out from the project plan. Goals move directly to the Done
column once they are reached.

The board is public and available at https://trello.com/b/m7tD31zU/iaas To be
able to comment on a card you'll need a Trello account. Most of the team
members use a Google account as their login identity.

Daily status meeting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The core team has daily meetings at 09:30 every work day. These are short
meetings meant to summarize what has been worked on since yesterday, what will
be done today and what blocks progress, if anything. Each team member is
expected to speak briefly about their own situation.

Daily meetings are held on Goolge Hangouts and published to the project
calendar. They are also announced in the chat room a few minutes before they
start.

Weekly planning meeting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The weekly planning meeting where we discuss direction, milestones and general
progress. This is the place for any larger topics or issues involving the full
team. To schedule a topic for this meeting project members make a card in
Trello and label it as *Discussion*.

The weekly status meeting is held on Google Hangouts and published to the
project calendar.

Project calendar
----------------

Meetings and events are published to a public Google calendar. It is possible
to `read it`_ as a webpage or `subscribe to it`_ in ical format.

.. _read it: https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=kum6d33mfvaotbuo2bc921eaoo%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe/Oslo
.. _subscribe to it: https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/kum6d33mfvaotbuo2bc921eaoo%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics

Right now you'll need to use the webpage interface to find the Google Hangouts
video links for each event. There is a plan to update the event description
field in the ical data with the Hangout URL by using `this Python code`_ but it
has not been done yet.

Social sharing platform
-----------------------

We have been using a NorCAMS Google Plus-community to share links of project
related information for a while. Anyone with relevant content is free to use
this as a channel. We put up a web redirect to the community page to make it
easier to find, it is at http://plus.norcams.org
