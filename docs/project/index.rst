About the project
=================

norcams/iaas is an open source effort focused around automating, documenting
and delivering all parts of a complete, Openstack-based production-quality
infrastructure. This repository is our project handbook.

Infrastructure as code and 'automation first' are the main technical driving
forces along with a general need for faster and more efficient delivery of
standardized, self-provisioned services among IT-departments in the Norwegian
academic sector.

Development is funded by the participating entities by contributing employees
and knowledge into a nationally distributed team of engineers.

Project goals are set, changed and validated within a formal project
organization where management from all contributing entities are present. This
project organization is named UH-sky and is coordinated by UNINETT, the
Norwegian NREN organization.
