Tracking the project
====================

Chat room
---------

All members of the project are expected to join and follow our chat room while
working. The chat room is used for socializing, status updates, informal quick
questions and coordinating various group efforts.

Commit messages from the most important git repositories we use are announced
in the chat room automatically.

To start using the chat room connect to a IRC server on the Freenode network
and join the #uh-sky room. Remember, everything in the room is logged on the
public internet at https://botbot.me/freenode/uh-sky/

Tasks and progress reporting
----------------------------

The project uses a Trello board for tasks and project planning. Core members
are expected to add and manage cards directly on the board. Tasks described on
the cards should not be too complicated to solve, ideally we want cards to flow
through the board each day. If we do this correctly we get a low-cost,
low-friction way of reporting progress and status.

*Divide and conquer* seems like a good idea to try for this. If a card stays in
the same column for a day, divide it and try to get smaller parts of it to Done!

The Goals column is a bit special. This is where we put larger goals and
milestones broken out from the project plan. Goals move directly to the Done
column once they are reached.

The board is public and available at https://trello.com/b/m7tD31zU/iaas To be
able to comment on a card you'll need a Trello account.

Morning meeting
---------------

The core team has daily meetings at 09:30 every work day. These are short
meetings meant to summarize what has been worked on since yesterday, what will
be done today and what blocks progress, if anything. Each team member is
expected to speak briefly about their own situation.

Morning meetings are held on Goolge Hangouts. The URL to the meeting is pasted
in the IRC chat a few minutes before it starts.

Weekly project meeting
----------------------

The project has a weekly status and planning meeting where we discuss
direction, milestones and general progress. This is the place for any larger
topics or issues involving the full team. To schedule a topic for this meeting
project members make a card in Trello and label it as *Discussion*.
